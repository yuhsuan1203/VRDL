# Visual Recognition using Deep Learning HW2
## Celebrity faces generation using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
* **DCGAN.ipynb**: all the code of this homework

* **DCGAN_with_training_image.ipynb**: similar to the above one, except with the generated images in each epoch during training process

* **celebA_face.gif**: an animated gif using the images saved during training

* **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml**: used to detect frontal face

* **my_helper.py**: include some useful function, such as crop the image to the desired size or save the generated image at the end

* **G.png**: model architecture of the generator

* **D.png**: model architecture of the discriminator
